# Belly Button Bacteria Dashboard

# Overview

For this project we built an interactive dashboard that displays information from a dataset of 153 participants. Each p paricipant provided a navel sample which was analyzed to document the type(s) of bacterial species that were present. The dataset contains a demographic profile, information on the bacterial species discovered and the participants' navel washing frequency.

participants can select ID number to see which bacterial species live in their navels

# Results

The dashboard serves two primary audiences:
1. Fellow researchers interested in the data are able to get an overview of the bacterial species present in each sample
2. Participants that provided samples are able to look up their information by filtering by their program ID
